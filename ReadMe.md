### Relevant Experience At the Defense Acquisition University (DAU), we are part of the dau.mil development team using DevOps in an Agile environment. As a teaming partner, we are actively engaged in all aspects of DevOps. dau.mil is a web portal providing training and other online resources for users across the Department of Defense. The site is hosted in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud and uses AWS Microservices,  Azure  Functions  and  Azure  Cognitive  Services. The site is programmed using a variety of programming languages, including Python,  C#,  ML.NET  and  Core  ML. Additionally, the site is built using much of the same open source technology presented in the RFI, including:
* Elasticsearch* Git  /  Enterprise  GitHub* Java,  Javascript* JIRA* Maven* Oracle  &  PL/SQL* Python* AngularJS* Spark* sparkML* TensorFlow
At DAU, we chose to use REST-based APIs instead of message streaming as this approach better fits the communications needs of DAU users. As a learning portal, information is best provided when requested by users. Key characteristics of this approach include:
* Request/response model — users send requests to an API server and receive a response.* Pull-based interaction — users send an API request when data or functionality is required.* Synchronous — users receive the response after a request is sent.* Multiple content types — since REST APIs are built upon HTTP, responses may be JSON, XML, or other content types as necessary to support user needs.* Flexible interactions — users may interact with REST-based APIs through resources in a variety of ways, incluidng queries/search, creating new resources, modifying existing resources, and deleting resources. * Caching and concurrency protocol support — HTTP has caching semantics built-in and eTags for concurrency control to prevent overwriting content.* Internal and external access — REST APIs may be restricted for internal use or for external use by partners or public developers.A key component of the DEVSEOPS process is Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline automation. Our CI/CD pipeline is shown in Figure 1.  ![CI\CD Pipeline](Images/pipeline.png)We have integrated a number of AI/ML platforms and capabilities in dau.mil, including:
* User feedback is routed through Microsoft Cognitive Services for Sentiment  Analysis. Also, near real-time analytics reports are generated using Power BI.* The DAU Point & Learn app uses Microsoft Vision Framework, Core ML and Tensor Flow to train a model that uses Augmented Reality (AR Kit and AR Core) to identify the Acquisition Framework objects through mobile devices camera. This provides an actionable Acquisition resource to students and the workforce at the point of need.* We developed Google Assistant based trivia games which use Natural  Language Processing (NLP) to enable a fun learning environment for students to validate their Acquisition skills.* We developed Amazon Alexa custom skills which use NLP to provide the recent Acquisition News, Blogs, Events and Campus operating status using REST APIs.
## Summary

As described above, IGI has the capabilities, experience and knowledgeable staff to develop complex IT projects using the DevOps CI/CD model in an Agile environment and industry standard open source products.
